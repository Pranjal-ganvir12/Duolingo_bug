# Duolingo_bug

A **simple Python project** that shows how streak systems work in apps like Duolingo.

## How it works

- ✅ First practice → streak starts at **1**
- 🔁 Practicing again the **same day** → streak stays the same
- 📅 Practicing the **next day** → streak goes **up by 1**
- ❌ Skipping **one or more days** → streak **breaks** and resets to **0**
